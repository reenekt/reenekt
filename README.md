### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Andrew Sementsov and I am a web developer based in Russia.

## About me
I am full-stack developer and I use Laravel and Vue (and Nuxt) as main working frameworks 
and PHP, Javascript (ES6 and newer) and Typescript as main programming languages, 
but I also know Yii2, a little bit of Python, a little bit of Go (Golang) and a little bit of other.

Most of time I work on "private" projects that is not visible in my Github profile. 
I've worked on CRM, online stores, landing pages and other complex websites and applications.

Sometimes I do mentoring and discuss development issues with my friends and colleagues. 
I like to share knowledge and learn new things ðŸ™‚.

I moved some my own projects (and projects created with my friends) to https://github.com/reenekt-lab. You can watch them if you want.
